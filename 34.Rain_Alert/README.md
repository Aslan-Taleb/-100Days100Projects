## SMS Weather Notifications

This is a Python script that sends SMS notifications about the weather conditions using the Twilio API and the OpenWeatherMap API. It determines if it's going to rain and sends an appropriate message accordingly.

## Prerequisites

To use this script, you need to have the following:

Python 3 installed on your machine

The requests library installed (pip install requests)

The twilio library installed (pip install twilio)

## Setup

Sign up for an account on Twilio and get your Account SID, Auth Token, and Twilio phone number.

Sign up for an account on OpenWeatherMap and get your API key.

## Configuration

In the script, replace the following placeholders with your own values:

account_sid: Your Twilio Account SID.

auth_token: Your Twilio Auth Token.

from_: Your Twilio phone number.

to: The phone number to which you want to send the weather notifications.

api_key: Your OpenWeatherMap API key.

## Usage : 

The script will retrieve the weather information for the specified latitude and longitude (in this example, it uses predefined coordinates) using the OpenWeatherMap API. It will then check if the weather condition indicates rain (weather code less than 700). If it's going to rain, an SMS notification with the message "Bring an umbrella ‚òÇÔ∏è" will be sent. Otherwise, an SMS notification with the message "It's ok üëï" will be sent.

Note: Make sure your machine has an internet connection for the script to retrieve weather information and send SMS notifications.

Feel free to modify the script according to your specific requirements and customize the SMS messages as needed.
