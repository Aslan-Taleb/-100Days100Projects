# Pixela API Python Script

This Python script interacts with the Pixela API to register users, create graphs, and add/delete data points to the specified graph. Pixela is a platform that allows you to create custom graphs to track various data over time.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python installed on your machine.
- The `requests` library installed (`pip install requests`).
- A Pixela account (sign up at [Pixela](https://pixe.la/)).

## Setup and Configuration

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pixela-api-python.git

2.Open the script (pixela_api.py) in a text editor.

Configure the following variables at the beginning of the script:

USERNAME: Your Pixela username.

GRAPH_ID: The ID of the graph you want to interact with.

TOKEN: Your Pixela API token.

Save your changes.

## Usage

he script will guide you through the following options:

Register a new Pixela user.

Create a new graph on your Pixela account.

Choose whether to add a new data point to the graph or delete an existing data point.

Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the required information.

## Usage Notes

You can use this script to automate the process of managing your Pixela graphs and data points.

Make sure to handle your Pixela API token securely and do not share it with others.

The script provides basic error handling, but you can extend it further to handle specific cases.
