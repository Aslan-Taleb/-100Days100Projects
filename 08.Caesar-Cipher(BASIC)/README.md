## Caesar Cipher :

The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique used to encode and decode messages. It involves shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions to create a secret message. This project provides a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages easily.

## Key Features : 

Encryption: Encode your message by shifting the letters of the alphabet.
Decryption: Decode the encrypted message by reversing the shifting process.
Shift Number: Choose the number of positions to shift the letters.
Encoding/Decoding Direction: Select whether to encode or decode the message.
Error Handling: Handle input errors gracefully and provide informative messages.
User-Friendly Interface: Clear instructions and prompts to guide you through the process.
Repeatability: Encrypt or decrypt multiple messages in a single session.

## How to Use : 

Run the script in a Python environment.
The program will display the Caesar Cipher logo.
Choose whether you want to encode or decode a message by typing 'encode' or 'decode'.
Enter your message in lowercase letters. Special characters and numbers will be ignored.
Specify the shift number, which determines how many positions the letters should be shifted.
The program will encrypt or decrypt your message based on your selection and display the result.
If any characters were ignored during the process, they will be shown in the output.
You can choose to continue encoding or decoding more messages or exit the program.
When you're finished, the program will bid you goodbye.
