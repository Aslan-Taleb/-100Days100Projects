# Tinder Auto-Liker

Tinder Auto-Liker is a Python script that automates the process of liking profiles on Tinder using a Facebook login. It uses Selenium to interact with the Tinder web application and automatically "likes" profiles.

## Prerequisites

Before running this script, make sure you have the following installed and configured:

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver (download and specify the path in the code)
- A valid Facebook account for login
- Tinder account

## Configuration

In the code, you need to configure the following:

- `FB_MAIL`: Your Facebook email address.
- `FB_PASSWORD`: Your Facebook password.
- `CHROME_DRIVE_PATH`: The path to your ChromeDriver executable.

## Usage

The script will open the Tinder website and log in using your Facebook credentials.

It will then automatically start "liking" profiles on Tinder.

The script is set to perform 100 "likes" per day as per Tinder's free tier limitations. You can adjust this if you have a premium account.

## Important Note
