## Tip Calculator

The Tip Calculator is a program that helps you calculate the tip amount and the amount each person should pay when splitting the bill. It provides a convenient way to determine the appropriate tip based on a percentage you choose and the number of people sharing the bill.

## Usage : 

When you run the program, you will be greeted with a welcome message.

You will then be prompted to enter the total bill amount. Enter the amount without the currency symbol (e.g., 100.50) and press Enter.

Next, you will be asked to choose the percentage tip you would like to give. You can choose from three options: 10%, 12%, or 15%. Enter the corresponding number (10, 12, or 15) and press Enter.

After that, you will be prompted to enter the number of people with whom you want to split the bill. Enter the number and press Enter.

The program will calculate the tip amount based on the percentage you chose and the total bill. It will then calculate the amount each person should pay by dividing the total bill plus tip by the number of people.

The calculated amount per person will be displayed on the screen.
