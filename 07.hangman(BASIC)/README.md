## Hangman

Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game that will test your vocabulary and deduction skills. Can you guess the word before the hangman is completed? Let's find out!

## Overview

Hangman is a text-based game where you try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. For each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. Your goal is to guess the word correctly before the hangman is fully formed.

## How to Play

Run the script in a Python environment.
Choose the language for the game: English (1) or French (2).
A random word will be selected from the corresponding word list.
The game will display a series of underscores representing the letters of the hidden word.
Enter a letter to make a guess. The letter should be lowercase.
If the letter is correct and present in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions.
If the letter is incorrect, you will lose a life, and a part of the hangman will be drawn.
Keep guessing letters until you either guess the word correctly or run out of lives.
The game will end with a win if you guess the word correctly or a loss if you run out of lives.
The chosen word will be revealed at the end of the game.
