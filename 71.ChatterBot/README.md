## Getting Started : 
To get started with the Assistant Generator, follow these steps:

Clone the repository or download the Python file containing the project.
Open the Python file in your preferred development environment or text editor.
Usage
Set your API key: Replace "your-api-key" in the code with your actual OpenAI API key.

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the name of the assistant you want. Enter the name as per your preference.

Once the assistant is set, you can have a conversation with the assistant. Enter your message or query, and the assistant will provide a response. The conversation will continue until you enter quit() as your input.
